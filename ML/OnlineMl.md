# Online Machine Learning  

**Online Machine Learning** is a method where the model learns from data as it arrives, little by little. Unlike batch learning, it doesn't wait for all the data to be available at once. Instead, it updates its knowledge whenever new data comes in, making it suitable for tasks where data changes continuously.  

---

## How It Works:  
1. **Data Input**: The machine receives one piece of data at a time.  
2. **Learning**: It learns from that data and adjusts its model (its "brain").  
3. **Continuous Updates**: Each new piece of data helps the model improve and stay current.

## Examples:  

### 1. Stock Market Predictions  
- **Description**: The model observes stock prices one by one and predicts the next prices.  
- **Why Online Learning?**: Stock prices change constantly, and the model needs to adapt quickly.  

### 2. Spam Email Detection  
- **Description**: The model checks each email and decides if it’s spam or not.  
- **Why Online Learning?**: New kinds of spam emails appear every day, so the model has to keep updating.  

### 3. Social Media Recommendations  
- **Description**: The model learns your preferences (likes, dislikes) one interaction at a time and suggests posts or ads accordingly.  
- **Why Online Learning?**: Your interests can change daily, so the model must adapt to show better suggestions.

## Analogy:  
Imagine preparing for a spelling bee:  
- Every day, your teacher gives you one new word to learn.  
- You add that word to your memory without forgetting what you learned before.  
- Over time, you become better at spelling without needing to study everything at once.  

---

## Advantages:  
1. Learns continuously, keeping the model updated.  
2. Works well with data that changes over time.  
3. Doesn’t need to store large datasets for training.  

---

## Disadvantages:  
1. Sensitive to bad data, which can mislead the model.  
2. Needs careful tuning to avoid forgetting older information.  
3. Less effective for static datasets where data doesn't change.
