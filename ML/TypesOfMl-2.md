# Types of Machine Learning: Detailed Notes

## **1. Supervised Learning**
### Definition:
The machine learns from labeled data (input-output pairs are provided).

### How it Works:
The model is trained on a dataset where the output (target) is already known, and it learns to predict outcomes for new data.

# Types of Data and Supervised Learning

## Data Types
1. **Numerical Data**:
   - Examples: Age, Weight, CGPA, IQ
   - **Representation**: Numerical values, e.g., `Age = 25`, `Weight = 68.5 kg`, `CGPA = 3.9`, `IQ = 120`.

2. **Categorical Data**:
   - Examples: Gender, Nationality
   - **Representation**: Categories or labels, e.g., `Gender = Male/Female`, `Nationality = Indian/American`.

## Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves using labeled input and output data to train models. Depending on the type of output, supervised learning can be categorized into **Regression** and **Classification**.

---

### 1. Regression
   - **Definition**: If the output (target variable) is numerical, the problem is termed as a **Regression** task.
   - **Mathematical Representation**: 
     - For a dataset \( D = \{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_n, y_n)\} \), where \( x_i \) represents input features and \( y_i \) is the numerical output.
     - The regression model predicts \( y \) as:
       \[
       \hat{y} = f(x) = w \cdot x + b
       \]
       where \( w \) is the weight (slope), and \( b \) is the bias (intercept).
   - **Visualization**:
     A straight line representing the relationship between \( x \) (input) and \( y \) (output) on a 2D plot:
     ```
     x-axis: Input (e.g., Study Hours)
     y-axis: Output (e.g., CGPA)

           |        *

             10     20     30
                 Study Hours
     ```
   - **Example Equation**:
     \[
     CGPA = 0.05 \cdot \text{Study Hours} + 2.5
     \]

---

### 2. Classification
   - **Definition**: If the output (target variable) is categorical, the problem is termed as a **Classification** task.
   - **Mathematical Representation**: 
     - The classification model predicts probabilities for each category \( C_k \):
       \[
       P(C_k | x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(w \cdot x + b)}}
       \]
       where \( w \) is the weight, \( x \) is the input, and \( b \) is the bias.
   - **Visualization**:
     A scatter plot showing the separation of categories (e.g., Male vs. Female based on height and weight):
     ```
     x-axis: Height (cm)
     y-axis: Weight (kg)

           ^
           |     M    F
         80|     M    F
           |  M  M    F
         60|  M  M    F
           +-------------------->
             150  160  170  180
                   Height
     ```
     \( M = Male \), \( F = Female \)

   - **Example Equation**:
     For logistic regression:
     \[
     P(\text{Gender = Male}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(1.2 \cdot \text{Height} - 0.8 \cdot \text{Weight} + 3)}}
     \]

## Summary
1. **Regression**:
   - Used for predicting continuous outputs.
   - Visualization: A line or curve representing the relationship between \( x \) and \( y \).
   - Example: Predicting CGPA or house prices.

2. **Classification**:
   - Used for predicting categorical outputs.
   - Visualization: A scatter plot with distinct regions for different categories.
   - Example: Identifying gender based on height and weight.

Both tasks rely on input-output relationships to make accurate predictions.



### Examples:
- **Predicting House Prices**: Based on features like size, location, and number of rooms.
- **Email Spam Classification**: Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
- **Predicting Student Grades**: Using study hours and attendance as input features.
- **Diagnosing Diseases**: Using patient data to predict the presence of a disease.

---

## **2. Unsupervised Learning**
### Definition:
The machine learns patterns and structures from unlabeled data (no outputs are provided).

### How it Works:
The model tries to find hidden patterns or groupings in the data.

### Examples:
- **Customer Segmentation**: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior (clustering).
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual transactions in bank accounts.
- **Image Compression**: Reducing image size while retaining important information (dimensionality reduction).
- **Topic Modeling**: Finding topics in a set of text documents.

---

## **3. Semi-Supervised Learning**
### Definition:
Combines both labeled and unlabeled data, with the majority being unlabeled.

### How it Works:
The machine learns patterns from a small amount of labeled data and applies them to the larger, unlabeled dataset.

### Examples:
- **Medical Diagnoses**: Improving diagnostic models with a few labeled patient records and many unlabeled ones.
- **Speech Recognition**: Training models with limited transcribed audio data.
- **Fraud Detection**: Identifying fraud with some labeled cases and many unlabeled ones.
- **Web Page Classification**: Categorizing websites with limited labeled examples.

---

## **4. Reinforcement Learning**
### Definition:
The machine learns by interacting with its environment and receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.

### How it Works:
The model continuously learns to make decisions by trial and error to maximize rewards.

### Examples:
- **Robotics**: Training robots to walk, grasp objects, or complete tasks.
- **Game Playing**: AI playing video games like chess or Go and improving over time.
- **Stock Trading**: Optimizing strategies for buying and selling stocks.
- **Traffic Signal Control**: Adjusting traffic lights for smooth traffic flow.
