# Types of Machine Learning: Detailed Notes

## **1. Supervised Learning**
### Definition:
The machine learns from labeled data (input-output pairs are provided).

### How it Works:
The model is trained on a dataset where the output (target) is already known, and it learns to predict outcomes for new data.

### Examples:
- **Predicting House Prices**: Based on features like size, location, and number of rooms.
- **Email Spam Classification**: Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
- **Predicting Student Grades**: Using study hours and attendance as input features.
- **Diagnosing Diseases**: Using patient data to predict the presence of a disease.

## **2. Unsupervised Learning**
### Definition:
The machine learns patterns and structures from unlabeled data (no outputs are provided).

### How it Works:
The model tries to find hidden patterns or groupings in the data.

### Examples:
- **Customer Segmentation**: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior (clustering).
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual transactions in bank accounts.
- **Image Compression**: Reducing image size while retaining important information (dimensionality reduction).
- **Topic Modeling**: Finding topics in a set of text documents.

## **3. Semi-Supervised Learning**
### Definition:
Combines both labeled and unlabeled data, with the majority being unlabeled.

### How it Works:
The machine learns patterns from a small amount of labeled data and applies them to the larger, unlabeled dataset.

### Examples:
- **Medical Diagnoses**: Improving diagnostic models with a few labeled patient records and many unlabeled ones.
- **Speech Recognition**: Training models with limited transcribed audio data.
- **Fraud Detection**: Identifying fraud with some labeled cases and many unlabeled ones.
- **Web Page Classification**: Categorizing websites with limited labeled examples.

## **4. Reinforcement Learning**
### Definition:
The machine learns by interacting with its environment and receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.

### How it Works:
The model continuously learns to make decisions by trial and error to maximize rewards.

### Examples:
- **Robotics**: Training robots to walk, grasp objects, or complete tasks.
- **Game Playing**: AI playing video games like chess or Go and improving over time.
- **Stock Trading**: Optimizing strategies for buying and selling stocks.
- **Traffic Signal Control**: Adjusting traffic lights for smooth traffic flow.

### Analogy:
- **Supervised Learning**: Like a student learning with a teacher giving answers.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Like exploring a new city without a map.
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Like learning with a few hints from a guide.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Like learning to ride a bike through trial and error.
