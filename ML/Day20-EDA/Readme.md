# Univariate Analysis in Machine Learning

## Definition
Univariate analysis focuses on analyzing one variable at a time. Its goal is to describe the distribution, central tendency (mean, median, mode), and dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation) of the variable. It is the simplest form of data analysis.

---

## Why is Univariate Analysis Important?
- **Understanding Data**: Helps understand the nature of a single variable.
- **Identifying Patterns**: Detects trends and outliers.
- **Feature Selection**: Assists in determining the importance of a variable.

---

## Common Techniques
1. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Mean, Median, Mode, Range, Variance, Standard Deviation.
2. **Visualization**:
   - Histograms, Boxplots, Bar charts, Density plots.
3. **Frequency Distribution**:
   - Understanding how data values are distributed.

## Example: Analyzing Age of Customers

### Dataset:

| Customer ID | Age |
|-------------|-----|
| 1           | 25  |
| 2           | 30  |
| 3           | 25  |
| 4           | 35  |
| 5           | 40  |

---

### Descriptive Statistics:
- **Mean**: \( \frac{25 + 30 + 25 + 35 + 40}{5} = 31 \)
- **Median**: Middle value = 30
- **Mode**: Most frequent value = 25
- **Range**: \( 40 - 25 = 15 \)

---

### Visualization: Histogram

| Age Range | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|
| 20-29     | 2         |
| 30-39     | 2         |
| 40-49     | 1         |

---

### Insights:
1. Most customers are between 20-39 years old.
2. The average age is 31.
3. Age 25 appears most frequently.
