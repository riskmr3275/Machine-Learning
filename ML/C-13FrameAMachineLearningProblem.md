# Explanation of Key Concepts

## 1. Business Problem to Machine Problem
- **Definition:** This means transforming a real-world problem into something a machine or computer can understand and solve.
- **Explanation:** A business problem is often described in words and involves human decisions. To solve it using machines, we break it down into a series of steps or tasks.
- **Example:** 
  - Business Problem: A company wants to predict how many people will buy their product next month.
  - Machine Problem: Use past sales data to build a model that predicts future sales.

## 2. Types of Problems
Problems can be categorized based on what we are trying to solve:
1. **Prediction Problems**:
   - Goal: Guess something about the future.
   - Example: Predicting tomorrow’s weather based on past weather data.
2. **Classification Problems**:
   - Goal: Sort items into categories.
   - Example: Identifying whether an email is spam or not.
3. **Clustering Problems**:
   - Goal: Group similar items together.
   - Example: Grouping customers based on their shopping habits.
4. **Regression Problems**:
   - Goal: Predict a number.
   - Example: Estimating the price of a house based on its features like size and location.

## 3. Current Solution
- **Definition:** This refers to the methods or tools currently being used to solve the problem, often without advanced technology.
- **Explanation:** Before building a machine solution, we need to understand how the problem is being solved today.
- **Example:** 
  - If a library manually tracks which books are borrowed, that’s the current solution.
  - If students are marked present by a teacher calling out names, that’s another example.

## 4. Getting Data
- **Definition:** Collecting information needed to understand and solve the problem.
- **Steps:**
  1. Identify what data you need.
  2. Decide where to find the data (e.g., surveys, databases, websites).
  3. Collect the data in an organized way.
- **Example:**
  - To know which fruits people like most, you can collect data by asking them or observing their choices in a market.

## 5. Metrics to Measure
- **Definition:** These are ways to check how well your solution works.
- **Common Metrics:**
  - **Accuracy:** How many times the solution was correct.
  - **Precision and Recall:** Used for classification problems (e.g., detecting spam).
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Used for predicting numbers, to check how close the predictions are to actual values.
- **Example:** If a machine predicts 8 out of 10 things correctly, its accuracy is 80%.

## 6. Online vs Batch
- **Online Processing:**
  - Data is handled one item at a time.
  - Example: You process incoming messages one by one in real-time.
- **Batch Processing:**
  - Data is collected first and then processed all at once.
  - Example: Your teacher collects all homework assignments and checks them together.

---

## 7. Check Assumptions
- **Definition:** Before solving a problem, verify the assumptions made about the data or the problem itself.
- **Steps:**
  1. List all assumptions (e.g., "Most people like chocolate ice cream").
  2. Test each assumption to ensure it’s valid (e.g., survey people to confirm).
- **Example:** If you assume all customers buy products online, check if some also shop in physical stores.
