Troubleshooting
Issue: Anaconda is not recognized in the terminal
Solution: Make sure Anaconda is added to your PATH during installation. If not, manually add it by adding the following line to your ~/.bashrc (Linux/macOS) or System Environment Variables (Windows):
bash
Always show details

Copy code
export PATH="~/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
Issue: Conda commands are not working
Solution: Try reinitializing Conda:

# Conda and Jupyter Commands Explained

## 1. `conda remove --name campusX --all`
This command removes the environment named `campusX` and all the installed packages within that environment. It's useful if you want to delete the environment entirely.

## 2. `conda deactivate`
Deactivates the current Conda environment, returning to the base environment (or the system’s default Python environment if there’s no base environment).

## 3. `jupyter notebook`
Launches the Jupyter Notebook application, which is a web-based interactive computing environment for running Python code, creating visualizations, and documenting the process.

## 4. `conda install numpy`
Installs the `numpy` package in the current Conda environment. Numpy is a popular Python package used for numerical computing.

## 5. `conda activate campusX`
Activates the Conda environment named `campusX`, so that any subsequent operations will use the Python version and packages installed in that environment.

## 6. `conda install -c anaconda jupyter`
Installs the `jupyter` package from the Anaconda repository into the current Conda environment. This is used for running Jupyter Notebooks.

## 7. `conda create --name campusX`
Creates a new Conda environment named `campusX`. If you want to specify Python or other packages, you can add them after `--name campusX`, like so:

## 8. `source ~/.bashrc`
Reloads the `~/.bashrc` file, which contains configurations for the shell environment. This is typically used to apply changes made to environment variables or paths.

## 9. `conda activate base`
Activates the `base` Conda environment, which is the default environment that is created when you install Anaconda or Miniconda.

## 10. `export PATH="~/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"`
Adds the directory `~/anaconda3/bin` to the `PATH` environment variable. This allows you to run Conda and Anaconda tools from the command line without needing to specify the full path.

## 11. `anaconda-navigator`
Launches the Anaconda Navigator GUI, which is a graphical interface for managing environments, packages, and launching applications like Jupyter Notebook or Spyder.
