# Batch Machine Learning

**Batch Machine Learning** is a type of learning where the model is trained on a large dataset all at once. After the training is complete, the model is fixed and doesn't learn further until retrained with a new dataset.

---

## How It Works:
1. Collect a **large dataset** (called a "batch").
2. Train the machine learning model using this dataset.
3. Use the trained model to make predictions or decisions.
4. If new data comes in, the model must be retrained with an updated batch.

## Examples:

### 1. Weather Forecasting
- **Description**: The model learns from a year's worth of weather data to predict the weather for the next day.
- **Key Point**: It won’t update predictions unless retrained with new data.

### 2. Exam Scores Prediction
- **Description**: A model is trained on data about how much students studied and their past scores to predict future exam scores.
- **Key Point**: The model remains fixed until new exam data is added for retraining.

### 3. Movie Recommendation System
- **Description**: Based on a batch of user ratings, the model recommends movies to users.
- **Key Point**: It won't include new ratings or preferences unless retrained.

## Analogy:
Imagine studying a multiplication table:
- You learn the entire table in one go (batch learning).
- You use it to solve problems.
- If the table changes, you need to relearn it completely.

---

## Advantages:
- Efficient for large datasets.
- Useful when data doesn’t change frequently.

## Disadvantages:
- Slow to update if new data arrives.
- Requires retraining for model updates.
